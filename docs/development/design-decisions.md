# Design Decisions

Lightweight Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for foundational choices
in dagzoo.

______________________________________________________________________

## 1. Latent variable edge sampling for DAG structure

### Context

The generator builds random DAGs to define causal structure. Each potential
edge needs a probability. Standard Erdős–Rényi graphs sample each edge with
the same fixed probability, producing homogeneous structure with thin-tailed
degree distributions.

### Decision

Edge probabilities follow an additive logit model using latent variables
drawn from a Cauchy distribution:

```
p_ij = sigmoid(A + B_i + C_j + edge_logit_bias)
```

where A is a global latent scalar, B_i is a per-source-node latent variable,
and C_j is a per-target-node latent variable, all drawn from the standard
Cauchy distribution. Only upper-triangular entries are kept to enforce
acyclicity.

This documents the current baseline implementation of **latent variable edge
sampling** and may be extended via future roadmap work while preserving
backward-compatible defaults.

### Rationale

- **Heavy tails via Cauchy latents** — using the Cauchy distribution for the
  latent variables produces occasional extreme logit values, creating natural
  variability in graph density within and across datasets. Some nodes become
  hubs; others stay sparse.
- **Node-level heterogeneity** — separate per-row (B_i) and per-column (C_j)
  terms let individual nodes have distinct connectivity profiles.
- **Global sparsity control** — the `edge_logit_bias` additive term shifts
  the entire probability surface up or down, enabling controlled graph-density
  variation across generated datasets.
- **Theoretical grounding** — directly implements the mechanism described in
  TabICLv2 Appendix E.4.

### Alternatives considered

- **Erdős–Rényi (uniform p)** — too homogeneous; every node looks the same.
- **Power-law degree sequences** — adds structural diversity but requires a
  separate degree-to-DAG conversion step and does not naturally give per-edge
  control.
- **Normal distribution for logits** — lighter tails suppress the extreme hub
  / isolate patterns that create interesting downstream data.

## 2. Torch-only generation pipeline (no NumPy)

### Context

The data generation pipeline involves sampling random graphs, applying
function families, running converters, and postprocessing. These operations
could use NumPy, PyTorch, or a mix.

### Decision

All tensor computation in the generation pipeline uses PyTorch exclusively.
NumPy is used only at the I/O boundary (Parquet serialization).

This reflects the current baseline execution path; future roadmap work may
expand mechanism/noise controls (RD-011/RD-012) while keeping generation
backend strategy explicit.

### Rationale

- **Device-agnostic** — the same code path runs on CPU, CUDA, and MPS
  without if/else branching for backend.
- **No transfer bottlenecks** — a mixed pipeline requires CPU↔GPU copies at
  every NumPy↔Torch boundary. Keeping everything in Torch avoids this.
- **Single RNG system** — `torch.Generator` provides deterministic,
  device-aware random number generation. Mixing in `numpy.random` would
  require maintaining two RNG states and reasoning about their interaction.

### Alternatives considered

- **NumPy-first** — simpler for CPU-only use, but forfeits GPU acceleration
  entirely.
- **Mixed NumPy + Torch** — maximizes library ergonomics per operation but
  introduces transfer overhead and dual-RNG complexity.

## 3. BLAKE2s for seed derivation

### Context

The generator uses a tree of deterministic seeds: one base seed spawns child
seeds for each component (graph sampling, function selection, data generation,
missingness, fixed-layout planning, etc.). The derivation function must map
`(base_seed, component_path)` to a child seed without collisions.

### Decision

Child seeds are derived via BLAKE2s hashing: encode the base seed and path
components as UTF-8, hash them, and extract a 32-bit integer from the digest.

This is the current seeded reproducibility baseline and can be revisited only
with an explicit migration plan for compatibility.

### Rationale

- **No collisions** — a cryptographic hash ensures that nearby inputs (e.g.,
  seeds 1000 and 1001, or paths "feature/0" and "feature/1") produce
  uncorrelated outputs. Simple arithmetic (addition, XOR) leaks input
  structure into the derived seed.
- **Uniform output** — BLAKE2s output bits are statistically uniform, so
  derived seeds cover the full 32-bit range evenly.
- **Fast** — BLAKE2s is specifically optimized for short inputs. The overhead
  per derivation is negligible compared to the tensor operations that follow.
- **Deterministic** — given the same base seed and component path, the
  derived seed is always identical, which is the foundation of reproducibility.

### Alternatives considered

- **Linear combination / XOR** — fast but produces structured collisions
  (e.g., `seed ^ 1` and `(seed+1) ^ 0` can alias).
- **SHA-256** — equally correct but slower than BLAKE2s for the short-input
  use case.
- **Counter-based (Philox/Threefry)** — good for bulk random streams but
  less natural for tree-structured seed hierarchies with string-named
  components.

## 4. Fixed-layout batch API as explicit opt-in

### Context

Some workflows need many datasets with the same sampled structure (feature
types, DAG shape, node assignments, and split sizes) so downstream
analysis can isolate value-level variation from layout-level variation.

### Decision

Expose a dedicated fixed-layout API:

- `sample_fixed_layout(...)` to sample one reusable plan.
- `generate_batch_fixed_layout(_iter)(...)` to emit many datasets from that plan.

Default `generate_batch(_iter)` behavior remains layout-dynamic.

### Rationale

- **Clear semantics** — callers choose fixed-layout behavior explicitly instead
  of relying on hidden coupling in default generation.
- **Lower branching complexity** — generation core stays simple; layout reuse is
  isolated in a dedicated path.
- **Emitted-schema contract** — fixed-layout batches guarantee aligned emitted
  columns (feature count/order and lineage mapping), so index-based downstream
  consumers can safely stack bundles.
- **Deterministic reproducibility** — one plan seed yields one stable layout
  signature, while dataset seeds still vary value realizations.

### Alternatives considered

- **Replace default generation behavior** — simpler surface area, but would
  change longstanding semantics for users expecting dynamic layout sampling.
- **Config-only fixed-layout mode** — convenient for CLI parity, but less clear
  than an explicit Python API and adds global mode branching.

## 5. `slots=True` dataclasses

### Context

The generator creates thousands of intermediate dataclass instances per batch
(dataset bundles, converter specs, seed managers, metrics containers, etc.).
Python dataclasses default to storing attributes in a per-instance `__dict__`.

### Decision

All dataclasses in the codebase use `@dataclass(slots=True)`.

This is a codebase-wide convention today, not a protocol contract.

### Rationale

- **Memory** — eliminates the per-instance `__dict__` allocation. When
  generating thousands of dataset bundles in a batch, the cumulative savings
  are meaningful.
- **Speed** — slot-based attribute access is a direct offset lookup instead
  of a dictionary lookup.
- **Safety** — prevents accidental attribute addition (e.g., typos like
  `bundle.metdata = ...`), signaling that these are structured containers
  with a fixed schema.

### Alternatives considered

- **NamedTuples** — immutable and memory-efficient, but lack default values
  and mutation support that dataclasses provide.
- **Plain dicts** — no attribute typo protection and no type annotation
  support.
- **`__slots__` without dataclasses** — equivalent runtime behavior but
  requires manual `__init__`, `__repr__`, etc.

## 6. Current function-family baseline

### Context

Each DAG node applies a random function to its parent values to produce a
latent representation. The choice of available function families determines
the space of possible data-generating processes.

### Decision

Current default family set includes eight families: neural network, tree ensemble, discretization (nearest
center), Gaussian process (random Fourier features), linear projection,
quadratic forms, EM-style soft assignment, and product (elementwise product
of two sub-families). Multi-parent nodes additionally use aggregation
strategies (sum, product, max, logsumexp).

Family and parameterization expansion is an explicit roadmap direction
(RD-011), with related noise-family expansion tracked separately (RD-012).

### Rationale

- **Theoretical grounding** — implements the mechanism families from
  TabICLv2 Appendix E.8.
- **Diversity across axes** — linear vs. nonlinear, smooth vs. piecewise,
  sparse vs. dense interactions. This diversity is necessary for the
  generated data to cover the space of real-world tabular relationships.
- **Multiplicative interactions** — the product family creates interaction
  effects not achievable by any single family, which is critical for
  modeling feature interactions in tabular data.
- **Composability** — multi-parent aggregation and the product family enable
  higher-order compositions without an exponential explosion in family count.

### Alternatives considered

- **Fewer families (e.g., NN-only)** — simpler but produces a narrower
  distribution of data characteristics. Neural networks alone struggle to
  produce sharp piecewise or nearest-neighbor-like structures.
- **More families** — diminishing returns on diversity; each new family adds
  code and testing surface. The current set covers the major structural
  archetypes.
- **Symbolic regression / GP trees** — expressive but hard to control for
  numerical stability and output distribution.

## 7. Noise family selection for RD-012 phase 1

### Context

Current generation uses implicit Gaussian-driven stochasticity throughout
matrix, weight, and point sampling, with optional global variance scaling via
`variance_sigma_multiplier` from shift controls. Epic `#24` and issue `#25`
introduce explicit user-facing noise-family configuration.

### Decision

Issue `#25` should start with four selectable modes:

- `gaussian`
- `laplace`
- `student_t`
- `mixture`

`mixture` is constrained to weighted combinations of Gaussian, Laplace, and
Student-t components only.

### Rationale

- **Simple baseline default** — `gaussian` remains the default and preserves
  seeded reproducibility with an explicit family label.
- **Coverage without excessive surface area** — Gaussian, Laplace, and
  Student-t provide progressively heavier tails with interpretable behavior.
- **Controlled flexibility** — `mixture` allows blended regimes without opening
  an unbounded family space in phase 1.
- **Numerical stability guardrails** — `student_t` should require `df > 2`
  to ensure finite variance and avoid unstable extreme draws.

### Alternatives considered

- **Expose Cauchy directly in phase 1** — rejected for now due infinite
  variance and high instability risk in downstream transforms.
- **Single-family only (Gaussian)** — rejected because it does not close the
  realism/robustness coverage gap targeted by RD-012.
- **Large family menu initially** — rejected to keep validation, docs, and
  benchmarking tractable for first delivery.

## 8. Single-source docs with Hugo-rendered reference pages

### Context

The docs site combines authored Markdown guides, two heavyweight technical
reference pages (`how-it-works` and `transforms`), and a Hugo/Docsy frontend.
Without a clear boundary between authored sources, generated Hugo inputs, and
deployable build output, contributors can end up editing the wrong files or
validating the wrong build tree.

### Decision

Maintain a single-source docs model with explicit generated boundaries:

- canonical authored docs live under `docs/`
- generated Hugo inputs live under `site/.generated/`
- `how-it-works.md` and `transforms.md` remain canonical reference sources in
  `docs/`
- Hugo renders those two pages directly as normal docs pages
- canonical built output is `site/public/`

Top-level `public/` is treated as stale local output from the older build flow,
not the deployment source of truth.

### Rationale

- **Clear edit boundaries** — contributors know whether they should edit
  `docs/`, generated Hugo inputs, or only local build artifacts.
- **Preserve canonical technical references** — the two heavyweight reference
  pages stay authored once and render inside the normal docs site without a
  separate static/iframe layer.
- **Deterministic docs automation** — `scripts/docs/sync_hugo_content.py` owns
  generated inputs and CI validates the same canonical build tree used for
  Pages deploys.

### Alternatives considered

- **Keep both `public/` and `site/public/` as equivalent outputs** — rejected
  because it creates ambiguity about link checking, deploy inputs, and local
  validation.
- **Keep a separate static canonical HTML layer** — rejected because it
  duplicates deployment paths and creates unnecessary wrapper/static plumbing.

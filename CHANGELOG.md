# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Historical note: entries below are ordered by release version. This file also
contains imported legacy history, so date order is not strictly monotonic:
`0.3.0` records the older `cauchy-generator -> dagzoo` rename, while `0.5.0`
records the later `dagsynth -> dagzoo` rename on the current release line.

## [0.9.9] - 2026-03-14

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** `dagzoo request` handoff manifests now use schema version `2`
  and add stable request-run and corpus identity, manifest-relative artifact
  paths, checksum metadata, and explicit curated-corpus defaults for downstream
  consumers.
- Request handoff docs now direct portable downstream consumers to the new
  relative artifact contract and clarify that the accepted-only curated corpus
  is the canonical training target.

## [0.9.8] - 2026-03-13

### Changed

- Improved PyPI package metadata with a clearer summary, explicit Markdown
  README rendering metadata, author attribution, search keywords, trove
  classifiers, and project links for docs, issues, repository, and changelog.

## [0.9.7] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- Added widened internal `gp` variants on the canonical fixed-layout path:
  `gp.standard`, `gp.periodic`, and `gp.multiscale`.
- Added `gumbel_softmax` as a sampled parametric activation family for random
  activation plans and fixed-layout execution metadata.
- Added curated GP-focused mechanism-diversity smoke presets for direct
  generation, diversity-audit, and filter-calibration workflows.

### Changed

- Default behavior for runs that sample the existing public `gp` family now
  broadens across internal GP variants; no new CLI flag or config section was
  added.
- Fixed-layout bundle metadata now emits additive
  `mechanism_families.sampled_variant_counts` and
  `mechanism_families.variants_present` fields alongside the existing
  family-level counts.
- Coverage summaries, diversity-audit reports, and filter-calibration reports
  now expose additive GP variant observability through
  `mechanism_family_summary.sampled_variant_counts` and
  `mechanism_family_summary.dataset_presence_rate_by_variant`.
- Fixed-layout metadata schema version is now `6` to reflect the widened
  `mechanism_families` payload on generated bundles.
- Public docs and roadmap guidance now treat shipped `piecewise` as the control
  path and widened `gp` as the active RD-011 candidate path.

## [0.9.6] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- Added an opt-in `piecewise` mechanism family to the fixed-layout sampler and
  batched execution path. It is available only through
  `mechanism.function_family_mix.piecewise` in this release, paired with at
  least one explicit branch family; the default sampler order is unchanged.
- Added curated mechanism-diversity smoke presets plus a dedicated feature
  guide for `piecewise` generate, diversity-audit, and filter-calibration
  workflows.

### Changed

- Fixed-layout bundle metadata now emits `mechanism_families` with realized
  sampled family counts, families present, and total realized function-plan
  count for each dataset bundle.
- Coverage summaries, diversity-audit reports, and filter-calibration reports
  now emit `mechanism_family_summary` in `summary.json` and render the same
  realized mechanism-family usage in `summary.md`.
- Fixed-layout metadata schema version is now `5` to reflect the new
  `mechanism_families` payload on generated bundles.

## [0.9.5] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- `dagzoo request` now writes a versioned `handoff_manifest.json` artifact at
  the request `output_root`, giving downstream consumers one machine-readable
  entrypoint for the curated filtered corpus, effective-config traceability,
  filter summaries, and request echo metadata.

### Changed

- `dagzoo request` CLI output now prints the handoff-manifest path alongside
  the existing generated/filter artifact locations.
- `dagzoo request` handoff manifests now report end-to-end wall-clock
  deferred-filter stage timing for request runs instead of the filter
  implementation's compute-only timing fields.
- `dagzoo request` now publishes `handoff_manifest.json` atomically via a
  staged temp file plus rename, avoiding truncated-manifest races for
  downstream consumers that watch the request `output_root`.
- Request workflow docs now describe the request-run artifact layout and the
  one-way `dagzoo -> tab-foundry` smoke handoff flow; closed-loop downstream
  feedback remains explicitly out of scope.

## [0.9.4] - 2026-03-11

### Changed

- Cleaned up internal technical debt by removing trivial dead wrappers,
  centralizing release-risk review policy, and adding stale docs-path checks to
  the repo verification workflow.
- Regrouped the fixed-layout execution stack under `src/dagzoo/core/fixed_layout/`
  and consolidated shared numeric helpers plus random matrix sampling under
  `src/dagzoo/math/`, removing the old flat module layout.
- Added shared test helpers for repo config loading, YAML/config file writing,
  and script-module loading, then migrated repeated test setup to those shared
  helpers.
- Normalized import ordering and sorted exported symbol lists across the repo,
  and refreshed docs references to the current `src/dagzoo/cli/` and
  `src/dagzoo/config/` package layout.

## [0.9.3] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- Added `dagzoo request --request <path>` as a request-file execution workflow
  that resolves a v1 request into the canonical `generate -> deferred filter`
  pipeline.

### Changed

- Request execution now writes artifacts under one stable `output_root`
  layout with `generated/`, `filter/`, and `curated/` subdirectories, and
  persists request effective-config plus resolution-trace artifacts under
  `generated/`.
- Config resolution now supports request-owned precedence for
  default/smoke profiles, public `rows` overrides, missingness-profile
  overlays, and `output_root` mapping to request-run generation output.

### Fixed

- `dagzoo request` now loads its built-in default and missingness preset
  configs from packaged wheel resources instead of repo-relative paths, so
  installed consumers can run request files outside a source checkout.
- `dagzoo request` now preserves the smoke profile envelope under CUDA hardware
  policies by reapplying the smoke caps before request config validation and by
  capping smoke rows before one-time run realization.
- Non-smoke `dagzoo request` runs now reapply request-owned `rows` specs after
  hardware-policy transforms, so supported CUDA policies preserve the same row
  precedence as `dagzoo generate --rows`.
- `dagzoo request` now converts malformed request YAML into the normal
  argparse-style usage error path instead of printing a traceback.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-03-11

### Changed

- Split the monolithic `dagzoo.cli`, `dagzoo.config`, `dagzoo.bench.suite`,
  `dagzoo.filtering.deferred_filter`, and fixed-layout core modules into
  smaller internal packages/modules while preserving the existing public CLI,
  config import surface, benchmark summary contracts, and deferred-filter
  artifact schema.
- Extracted fixed-layout batching, execution-semantic sampling, and runtime
  preparation/grouping helpers into dedicated internal modules so the core
  generation paths keep one canonical implementation without parallel legacy
  code paths.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-03-10

### Added

- Added `dagzoo filter-calibration` as a threshold-sweep workflow for one
  filter-enabled config, with consolidated `summary.json` / `summary.md`
  artifacts that rank accepted-corpus throughput against diversity shift.

### Fixed

- `dagzoo filter-calibration` now preserves distinct candidate labels for
  fine-grained threshold sweeps, reconstructs candidate rows without relying
  on label-keyed maps, and keeps full normalized threshold precision in CLI
  and markdown status output.
- `dagzoo diversity-audit` now uses one shared probe seed from the baseline
  config across the baseline and every variant, so seed drift is no longer
  reported as a diversity regression.
- `dagzoo diversity-audit` and `dagzoo filter-calibration` now reuse one
  baseline-derived diagnostics coverage aggregation config for the whole run,
  so diagnostics-only settings drift cannot create synthetic diversity shifts.
- `dagzoo diversity-audit` and `dagzoo filter-calibration` now reject
  non-finite or swapped `--warn-threshold-pct` / `--fail-threshold-pct`
  values so CLI guardrails cannot be silently disabled or inverted by bad
  input.
- `dagzoo filter-calibration` now rejects non-finite or out-of-range baseline
  `filter.threshold` values from the resolved config before building sweep
  candidates or artifacts.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-03-10

### Removed

- Replaced the legacy `dagzoo diversity-audit` local/equivalence and arm-set
  workflow. The command no longer accepts `--config`, `--phase`, `--arm-set`,
  `--num-datasets-per-arm`, `--seed`, `--n-seeds`, `--n-rows`, `--n-cols`,
  `--out-dim`, `--nn-degenerate-trials`, `--exact-affine-rmse`,
  `--near-cosine`, `--near-affine-rmse`, `--meaningful-threshold-pct`,
  `--baseline`, or `--save-baseline`.
- Removed legacy diversity-audit artifacts such as `run_summary.json` and
  `equivalence_report.json`; the rewritten audit now persists only
  `summary.json` and `summary.md`.

### Changed

- Rewrote `dagzoo diversity-audit` as a baseline-vs-variant accepted-corpus
  comparison workflow driven by `--baseline-config` plus one or more
  `--variant-config` values.
- Replaced the monolithic effective-diversity implementation with a package
  built around shared corpus probes, accepted-corpus coverage summaries, and
  per-variant diversity shift scoring.
- Diversity-audit now resolves one shared probe size from the baseline config
  for the whole run, replays the measured corpus in a second streaming pass
  instead of buffering full corpora in memory, and treats
  `insufficient_metrics` as a non-passing audit result for
  `--fail-on-regression`.

## [0.8.2] - 2026-03-10

### Changed

- Benchmark preset results now expose
  `filter_accepted_datasets_per_minute` so accepted-corpus throughput is a
  first-class metric alongside filter-stage throughput and dataset-level
  acceptance yield.
- Newly saved benchmark baselines now persist
  `filter_accepted_datasets_per_minute` in the default gating metric set, so
  `--baseline` and `--fail-on-regression` catch accepted-corpus throughput
  regressions by default.
- Added a public filter-enabled smoke benchmark preset and documented the
  canonical benchmark command plus the summary fields to inspect for accepted
  throughput and acceptance/rejection yield.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-03-10

### Changed

- Fixed deferred-filter packed-split replay so one Parquet record batch can
  contain adjacent datasets with different feature widths without raising a
  false ragged-shape error.
- Benchmark preset results now replace the misleading
  `accepted_datasets_measured` field with explicit filter-stage dataset-yield
  telemetry: accepted count, rejected count, acceptance rate, and rejection
  rate. CLI and markdown benchmark summaries now print the new dataset-level
  filter accept/reject percentages alongside the existing attempt-level filter
  rejection pressure metrics.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-10

### Removed

- Deleted dead `scripts/benchmark-issue148-cuda-desktop.sh` and its
  `configs/benchmark_filter_enabled.yaml` (issue closed).
- Removed the `dagzoo filter --config` fallback path; deferred filtering now
  replays strictly from embedded shard metadata.
- Removed automatic MPS-to-CPU retry in fixed-layout generation; backend
  runtime failures now surface directly.
- Removed legacy untyped fixed-layout execution-plan coercion from runtime
  generation paths.
- Removed lazy `dagzoo.functions` `apply_*` re-exports.
- Removed trivial `_standardize()` wrapper in `random_functions.py`; callers
  now use `sanitize_and_standardize()` directly.
- Removed redundant local `import math as _math` inside `sanitize_json()`.

### Added

- Clarifying comment on `correction=0` in `missingness._standardize_columns()`.

### Changed

- Broke the `layout` / `node_pipeline` / `fixed_layout_batched` dependency
  cycle by moving fixed-layout node specs onto one typed converter contract.
- Centralized generator-config cloning semantics under
  `clone_generator_config(...)` and reused shared packed-parquet writer helpers
  in deferred filtering.
- `device_fallback_reason` remains in emitted metadata for contract stability,
  but current generation leaves it `null`.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-10

### Changed

- Removed the legacy `dagzoo.rng.SeedManager` and `dagzoo.rng.offset_seed32`
  compatibility helpers so `KeyedRng` is now the repo's only semantic RNG
  surface.
- Benchmark throughput, latency, microbench, lineage-guardrail, and
  reproducibility helpers now derive seeds from explicit keyed benchmark
  namespaces instead of offset formulas and manual-seeded compatibility paths.
- Benchmark suite outputs now distinguish exact reproducibility from
  workload-shape stability by emitting both content and workload match signals
  for reproducibility checks.

## [0.6.7] - 2026-03-10

### Changed

- Canonical runtime orchestration, layout sampling, correlated sampling,
  dataset-level noise-family selection, split permutation, missingness, and
  postprocess now derive randomness from explicit keyed namespaces instead of
  offset-only stage seeds and shared compatibility wrappers.
- Fixed-layout plan preparation now keys run-level rows realization, shared
  plan candidates, node-spec sampling, and dataset attempt roots explicitly,
  and canonical bundle metadata now records exact keyed subtree replay paths in
  `keyed_replay` while preserving `dataset_seed` and `layout_plan_seed` as
  stable child-seed identifiers for deferred filter replay and diagnostics.
- Classification fixed-layout replay now keeps cached retry planning and actual
  retry execution on aligned keyed roots, falling back to scalar generation for
  runs that require nonzero per-dataset retry attempts so replay stays correct
  with the current chunk-scoped raw batch kernels.

## [0.6.5] - 2026-03-09

### Changed

- Fixed-layout typed plan sampling and execution now derive randomness from
  semantic keyed namespaces instead of shared ambient draw order, so regrouping
  parent execution, converter execution, and nested function-plan sampling no
  longer perturbs sibling randomness.
- `apply_random_function()`, `apply_multi_function()`, `apply_node_pipeline()`,
  numeric/categorical converter helpers, and random-points sampling now route
  generator-based entrypoints through keyed `plan` and `execution` roots while
  preserving their public call surface.
- Fixed-layout batch execution now keys batched matrix, activation, parent,
  source, product, tree, and converter draws by semantic role, and grouped vs
  split converter execution paths now remain deterministic for the same keyed
  root.

## [0.6.4] - 2026-03-09

### Added

- Added `dagzoo.rng.KeyedRng`, a keyed namespace helper for deriving
  deterministic child seeds and device-aware `torch.Generator` instances from
  one base seed plus a semantic path.

### Changed

- `SeedManager.child()` and `SeedManager.torch_rng()` now delegate through the
  keyed RNG substrate while preserving the existing `derive_seed()` and
  `offset_seed32()` compatibility surface.

## [0.6.3] - 2026-03-09

### Changed

- Deferred filter replay now streams packed shard inputs dataset-by-dataset
  instead of materializing whole shard tables in Python memory, stages
  manifest/curated outputs until shard and run validation succeed, and
  validates packed split ordering and coverage during replay.
- Deferred filter now refuses stale `--out` manifest/summary directories from a
  prior run and rejects symlinked lineage entries when copying curated shard
  lineage artifacts.
- Canonical fixed-layout classification preparation now caches the first valid
  retry attempt per dataset for the requested run so singleton retry fallback
  can skip already-proven invalid attempts without changing emitted metadata or
  dataset artifact layout.
- Removed several runtime-unused private helper paths and duplicate scalar
  implementations across random functions, postprocess aliases, node pipeline,
  converters, and sampling helpers to keep the active execution surface smaller
  and easier to interpret.
- Test execution now relies on the installed package layout instead of
  force-inserting `src/` onto `sys.path`, and CI now runs a Python `3.13` /
  `3.14` matrix with a `vulture` dead-code check plus manual `workflow_dispatch`
  support.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-03-08

### Changed

- Fixed-layout auto batch sizing now accepts an optional
  `runtime.fixed_layout_target_cells` override, and the built-in benchmark CPU,
  CUDA desktop, and CUDA H100 presets pin explicit target-cell budgets instead
  of relying on the single global default.
- CUDA config resolution now fills `runtime.fixed_layout_target_cells` from a
  memory-scaled floor for desktop, datacenter, and H100-class hardware when the
  config leaves that field unset, even when `--hardware-policy none` is used.
  Explicit preset or user-configured values are preserved. `cuda_tiered_v1`
  reuses the same floor logic alongside its broader tier-specific config
  transforms, including the unknown-CUDA fallback tier.
- Added an internal throughput sweep helper that benchmarks a small grid of
  `fixed_layout_target_cells` values and reports the best-performing candidate
  for the detected hardware tier. CUDA sweeps now start at the active
  memory-scaled floor/current target and explore upward instead of using a
  stale low static grid.

### Breaking

- **BREAKING:** Emitted dataset metadata now serializes the optional
  `config.runtime.fixed_layout_target_cells` field inside the persisted config
  payload when present. Consumers that validate the nested config payload
  against an exact schema should allow that key.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-03-08

### Changed

- Fixed-layout mixed-noise runs no longer fall all the way back to singleton
  dataset generation when a chunk samples multiple runtime noise families.
  Chunks now stay batched by subgrouped noise contract and preserve original
  dataset order through finalization.
- Fixed-layout batched tree execution now samples ODT splits, leaf indices, and
  leaf-value gathers in tensorized batch form instead of using per-dataset
  Python loops.
- Fixed-layout batched activation and quadratic matrix paths now avoid
  per-dataset or per-output Python loops, flatten fixed-activation application
  across batch dimensions, and reduce repeated mean/std reduction overhead in
  batched standardization.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-07

### Changed

- `generate_one`, `generate_batch`, and `generate_batch_iter` now sample one
  internal fixed-layout plan per run and execute generation through the
  fixed-layout engine instead of the old per-dataset dynamic layout path.
- Variable `dataset.rows` modes now resolve once per run. All datasets emitted
  from the same `generate` run share the same realized `n_train` / `n_test`
  split, and `effective_config.yaml` records that realized split.
- `dagzoo benchmark` now uses the same canonical fixed-layout generation path as
  `dagzoo generate`, reports `generation_mode="fixed_batched"` on that path,
  and caps smoke-suite `dataset.rows` before run realization.
- The old dynamic executor has been removed. Canonical split/finalization logic
  now lives in shared internal runtime helpers used by fixed-layout execution.
- Parallel-generation scaffolding and worker-partition wiring have been removed
  from the active product surface.

### Breaking

- **BREAKING:** Public generation no longer samples a fresh layout per dataset.
  One run now samples one fixed-layout plan and all emitted datasets in that run
  share its layout lineage and execution-plan provenance.
- **BREAKING:** `dataset.rows` `range` / `choices` no longer vary per dataset
  within a run. They now realize once per run.
- **BREAKING:** Generated bundles from the canonical `generate_*` APIs now carry
  fixed-layout provenance metadata (`layout_mode`, `layout_signature`,
  `layout_plan_seed`, `layout_plan_signature`, and execution-contract fields).
- **BREAKING:** The public `dagzoo fixed-layout ...` CLI workflow has been
  removed, and the top-level fixed-layout generation exports are no longer part
  of the public Python package surface.
- **BREAKING:** `runtime.worker_count` and `runtime.worker_index` are no longer
  supported runtime config keys for generation, benchmark, or diversity-audit
  flows.
- **BREAKING:** Local parallel-generation orchestration and the old dynamic
  generation executor have been removed rather than left as dormant product
  paths.

## [0.5.7] - 2026-03-07

### Added

- Added `dagzoo fixed-layout sample` and `dagzoo fixed-layout generate` CLI
  subcommands for sampling reusable fixed-layout plan artifacts and generating
  datasets from saved plans.

### Changed

- Upgraded fixed-layout generation to freeze node execution plans in the saved
  plan artifact and generate raw graph tensors in batched `N x rows x features`
  chunks before per-dataset finalization.
- Fixed-layout plan artifacts now serialize `node_plans`,
  `plan_signature`, `execution_contract`, and `schema_version: 3`, and
  emitted fixed-layout bundles now include `metadata.layout_plan_signature`.
- Built-in CPU benchmark runs (`dagzoo benchmark --preset cpu`) now expand into
  explicit `1024`, `4096`, and `8192` total-row profiles, use the fixed-layout
  batched generator by default for those row profiles, and report
  `generation_mode="fixed_batched"` plus explicit dataset row counts in
  benchmark results.
- Fixed-layout raw generation now uses a chunk-scoped batched RNG contract and
  grouped converter execution in the fixed-layout batched engine.
- Built-in CPU benchmark fixed-layout runs now pin one internal fixed-layout
  batch size per preset run so throughput, reproducibility, and lineage
  guardrail generation use the same chunking contract.
- Emitted fixed-layout bundles now include
  `metadata.layout_plan_schema_version` and
  `metadata.layout_execution_contract`.
- Fixed-layout replay now uses the current requested device instead of the
  plan's sampling backend provenance, and `dagzoo fixed-layout generate --device ...` now controls replay backend selection correctly.
- Fixed-layout generation again retries on CPU when `--device auto` resolves to
  `mps` and the batched fixed-layout runtime hits an unsupported MPS op.

### Breaking

- **BREAKING:** Fixed-layout plan artifacts changed schema in this release.
  Older serialized plan payloads without execution plans or plan signatures are
  no longer accepted by `generate_batch_fixed_layout(_iter)` or the new
  `dagzoo fixed-layout generate` CLI.
- **BREAKING:** The built-in CPU benchmark preset no longer measures the
  dynamic-layout generator path by default and no longer emits a single CPU
  result row. It now emits `cpu_rows1024`, `cpu_rows4096`, and `cpu_rows8192`
  results; benchmark artifacts distinguish `generation_mode="fixed_batched"`
  and `generation_mode="dynamic"` and include explicit dataset row counts.
- **BREAKING:** Fixed-layout plan artifacts now serialize `schema_version: 3`
  and `execution_contract: "chunk_batched_v1"`.
- **BREAKING:** Fixed-layout outputs are no longer batch-size independent. The
  current contract is deterministic for the same `plan + run seed + batch_size`,
  but changing `batch_size` may change the emitted dataset values.

## [0.5.6] - 2026-03-07

### Changed

- Improved practical generation throughput in shared Torch generation paths by
  caching per-layout parent index lists, removing redundant latent-width checks
  in the node pipeline, vectorizing quadratic random-function evaluation, using
  `torch.cdist()` for discretization nearest-center selection, and reducing
  intermediate allocations in multi-input aggregation.
- These changes affect both single-worker generation and the local CPU
  multi-worker benchmark path because they optimize shared generation kernels
  instead of benchmark-only accounting.

## [0.5.5] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- Added process-based local CPU multi-worker benchmark orchestration for
  `dagzoo benchmark` when `runtime.worker_count > 1`,
  `runtime.worker_index == 0`, and `--preset custom` is used.

### Changed

- Benchmark throughput, reproducibility, and lineage guardrail generation paths
  now use the local multi-worker iterator when multi-worker benchmark mode is
  active.
- Local multi-worker benchmark fan-out now caps to host CPU capacity before the
  benchmark coordinator spawns worker processes and bounded IPC queues.
- The process-based local multi-worker coordinator now uses bounded per-worker
  result queues, preserving deterministic ordering without deadlocking on slow
  low-index workers, tolerating clean-exit result/control message reordering,
  cleaning up IPC queues on worker-startup failures, and avoiding unbounded
  out-of-order result accumulation.
- True local multi-worker benchmark runs now coerce `runtime.device: auto` to
  CPU after effective fan-out resolution, while effectively single-worker runs
  keep their requested device behavior.
- Multi-worker benchmark summaries now report latency fields and
  `micro_generate_one_ms` as unavailable when the run actually uses multiple
  active worker partitions, avoiding misleading single-worker timings.
- True local multi-worker benchmark summaries now also report memory fields as
  unavailable, because coordinator-only RSS and CUDA counters do not represent
  child worker processes.
- Effectively single-worker benchmark runs now stay on the sequential
  generation path for both warmup and measured passes even when
  `runtime.worker_count > 1`, avoiding unnecessary coordinator overhead for
  tiny runs.

### Breaking

- **BREAKING:** True local multi-worker `dagzoo benchmark` runs remain CPU-only
  in this release; effectively single-worker runs keep their requested device,
  but explicit `cuda`/`mps` requests are still rejected once effective fan-out
  exceeds one local worker.
- **BREAKING:** `dagzoo generate` still does not orchestrate peer workers, and
  write-enabled multi-worker generate runs remain blocked until shard-writing
  coordination lands.

## [0.5.4] - 2026-03-06

### Changed

- `dagzoo benchmark` now rejects `--device` when multiple `--preset` values are
  selected instead of silently ignoring the override.
- Docs tooling now treats `site/public/` as the canonical built Hugo output in
  local workflows and CI, removing the previous `public/` vs `site/public/`
  ambiguity.
- Developer docs now explicitly document the docs wrapper model, current
  coverage-report omission for `src/dagzoo/bench/*`, and the current
  MPS-to-CPU hardware-tier mapping.
- Coverage reporting now includes `src/dagzoo/cli.py`; only `src/dagzoo/bench/*`
  remains omitted in this pass.
- Script documentation now matches the actual reference-fetch workflow and
  documents the standalone effective-diversity audit helper.
- Added a safe local-artifact cleanup helper for ignored runtime/docs outputs.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Added worker-partition runtime schema fields:
  `runtime.worker_count` and `runtime.worker_index`.
- Added deterministic round-robin worker partitioning for
  `dagzoo generate --no-dataset-write`, where `num_datasets` remains the global
  dataset-index space and each worker covers a disjoint subset.

### Breaking

- **BREAKING:** `dagzoo generate` now rejects write-enabled runs when
  `runtime.worker_count > 1`. Multi-worker mode is currently supported only with
  `--no-dataset-write` until shard-writing coordination lands.
- **BREAKING:** `dagzoo benchmark` and `dagzoo diversity-audit` now reject
  configs with `runtime.worker_count > 1` until those flows become
  partition-aware.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed

- Benchmark suite generation paths now consistently use a filter-disabled
  runtime config across throughput, latency, reproducibility, microbenchmarks,
  lineage guardrails, and missingness/shift/noise control runs. Presets with
  `filter.enabled=true` no longer crash benchmark execution after throughput.
- Benchmark `filter_retry_dataset_rate` now uses a denominator from the same
  sampled population as replayed filter rejections when deferred filter-stage
  replay metrics are active, preventing systematic underreporting on sampled
  suites.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-05

### Added

- Added a new deferred filtering CLI stage:
  `dagzoo filter --in <shard_dir> --out <out_dir>` with optional
  accepted-only curated shard output via `--curated-out`.
- Added deferred filter manifest (`filter_manifest.ndjson`) and summary
  (`filter_summary.json`) artifacts for acceptance auditing and throughput
  reporting.

### Changed

- Generated bundle metadata now always marks deferred filter state using
  `metadata.filter.mode` and `metadata.filter.status` (`not_run` immediately
  after generation).
- Benchmark filter stage throughput now replays deferred filtering over sampled
  bundles and reports replay-derived filter attempts/rejections when the filter
  stage is enabled.

### Breaking

- **BREAKING:** Inline filtering was removed from generation. `dagzoo generate`
  now errors when `filter.enabled=true`; users must run `dagzoo filter` as a
  separate stage.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-03

### Changed

- **BREAKING:** Renamed package from `dagsynth` to `dagzoo`. All imports change
  from `from dagsynth ...` to `from dagzoo ...`.
- **BREAKING:** Lineage schema name changed from `dagsynth.dag_lineage` to
  `dagzoo.dag_lineage`. Existing Parquet files with the old schema name will not
  validate against the new constant.

## [0.4.9] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed

- Benchmark runtime guardrail control runs now execute the same per-bundle
  callback instrumentation (stage-sample update + throughput-pressure
  collection) as the primary throughput run, removing callback-overhead skew
  from missingness/shift/noise runtime degradation comparisons.
- Benchmark stage-sample bundles are now released immediately after write/filter
  stage probes, reducing avoidable bundle/tensor retention before latency
  collection and guardrail control runs.
- Filter stage throughput now uses benchmark-only runtime timing captured on
  pre-filter tensors (`bundle.runtime_metrics.filter_elapsed_seconds`), keeping
  emitted metadata deterministic while avoiding replay skew from postprocessing
  and missingness-transformed outputs.

## [0.4.8] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed

- Scalar RNG draws (`torch.randint`, `torch.rand`) now explicitly target the
  generator's device via new `rand_scalar`/`randint_scalar` helpers, fixing
  failures when the generator lives on a non-CPU device.
- Generation retry exception logging now includes the exception message for
  easier debugging.

### Changed

- Benchmark suite summaries now emit stage-level throughput metrics for
  generation, parquet writing, and filter replay:
  `generation_datasets_per_minute`, `write_datasets_per_minute`, and
  `filter_datasets_per_minute` (nullable when filtering is disabled).
- Benchmark suite summaries now emit throughput-pressure metrics required for
  end-to-end interpretation, including attempt pressure and both filter
  rejection views:
  `filter_rejection_rate_attempt_level` and `filter_retry_dataset_rate`.
- Benchmark baseline defaults now gate on stage throughput metrics in addition
  to `datasets_per_minute`.
- Benchmark CLI single-line preset summaries and markdown reports now include
  stage throughput and filter rejection telemetry columns.
- Added RTX 3060 to the hardware peak FLOPS lookup table.

### Breaking

- Generated bundle metadata now includes a new additive
  `metadata.generation_attempts` object. Consumers with strict metadata schemas
  must allow this field.

## [0.4.7] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed

- Generate config resolution now applies CLI `--rows` overrides before final
  post-policy validation, preventing premature failures when CUDA tiered
  policies raise `dataset.n_test`.
- Benchmark preset resolution now rejects `dataset.rows` before hardware-policy
  transforms, so users consistently receive the intended unsupported-feature
  error message.

## [0.4.6] - 2026-03-04

### Added

- Added unified total-row control for generation via `dataset.rows` and
  `dagzoo generate --rows ...`.
- `dataset.rows` supports:
  - fixed totals (for example `1024`)
  - ranges (for example `400..60000`)
  - choice lists (for example `1024,2048,4096` or YAML list form)
- Variable rows specs now resolve deterministically per dataset seed lineage.

### Changed

- When `dataset.rows` is active, split resolution keeps `dataset.n_test` fixed
  and derives `n_train = total_rows - n_test`.
- Fixed-layout APIs now require fixed row modes; variable `dataset.rows`
  (range/choices) fail fast with clear compatibility errors.
- Benchmark config resolution now rejects `dataset.rows` (benchmark paths remain
  on explicit `dataset.n_train` / `dataset.n_test` for now).
- Generated metadata config snapshots now reflect realized split sizes for each
  emitted bundle.

### Removed

- Retired curriculum shell workflow: removed
  `scripts/generate-curriculum.sh` and its test coverage.

### Breaking

- **BREAKING:** Curriculum shell users must migrate to `dataset.rows` /
  `--rows` workflows for staged row-envelope generation.

## [0.4.5] - 2026-03-04

### Fixed

- Effective-diversity baseline regression comparison now fails fast on
  incompatible baselines (schema/version/suite/arm-set/config-fingerprint
  mismatch and missing evaluated-arm baseline entries) instead of silently
  passing.
- Effective-diversity scale audit now builds combined ablation arms from
  runtime-applicable mappings only, so unavailable activations do not force
  combined-arm skips.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-03-04

### Changed

- Added a first-class `dagzoo diversity-audit` CLI command that runs local
  overlap checks and dataset-scale overlap-impact ablations with reproducible
  run artifacts.
- Effective-diversity local auditing now reads activation names from runtime
  source-of-truth (`fixed_activation_names`) to avoid stale claim coverage when
  activation pools change.
- Added scale-impact baseline persistence and regression comparison workflow for
  repeated effective-diversity audits as the repository evolves.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-03-03

### Fixed

- Corrected mechanism-family sampling to iterate only across positive-probability
  families so `mechanism.function_family_mix` remains a strict hard mask even
  when RNG draws are exactly zero.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-03-03

### Changed

- Added `mechanism.function_family_mix` config support with strict
  normalization/validation and active runtime enforcement:
  unspecified families are excluded from sampling, and shift
  `mechanism_scale` reweights only within enabled families.
- Added `swiglu` to the global random activation pool as a shape-preserving
  variant (`x * silu(x)`).

### Breaking

- Generated bundle `metadata.config` now includes the top-level `mechanism`
  section (persisted config-schema extension). Consumers with strict
  schema expectations must allow this new section.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-03

### Changed

- Stabilized smoke benchmark CI behavior by disabling lineage runtime-overhead
  guardrail gating for smoke-size samples while retaining lineage metadata
  coverage validation.
- Lineage runtime degradation guardrails remain enabled for larger suites (for
  example `standard`) where sample sizes are sufficient for stable runtime
  comparisons.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-03

### Changed

- Renamed shift terminology in config/runtime/metadata:
  - `shift.mode` (was `shift.profile`)
  - `shift.variance_scale` (was `shift.noise_scale`)
  - `variance_sigma_multiplier` (was `noise_sigma_multiplier`) in emitted shift metadata
- Renamed noise amplitude key to `noise.base_scale` (was `noise.scale`) and standardized emitted dataset metadata under `noise_distribution` (was `noise`).
- Renamed benchmark preset terminology across config/CLI/summary payloads:
  - `benchmark.preset_name` (was `benchmark.profile_name`)
  - `benchmark.presets` (was `benchmark.profiles`)
  - summary keys `preset_results` / `preset_key` (was `profile_results` / `profile_key`)
- Renamed benchmark script/docs terminology from profile-centric wording to preset/tier wording.
- Replaced internal layout dict contracts with `LayoutPlan` dataclass wiring in generation/layout/metadata paths.
- Added explicit device-resolution metadata fields on generated bundles:
  - `requested_device`
  - `resolved_device`
  - `device_fallback_reason`
- Renamed diagnostics target bridge module:
  - `meta_targets.py` -> `diagnostics_targets.py`
  - `build_coverage_aggregation_config` -> `build_diagnostics_aggregation_config`

### Breaking

- `dagzoo benchmark --profile ...` was removed; use `--preset ...`.
- `dagzoo generate --no-write` was removed; use `--no-dataset-write`.
- Config files using `shift.profile`, `shift.noise_scale`, `noise.scale`, `benchmark.profile_name`, or `benchmark.profiles` must be migrated to the new keys above.
- Dataset metadata consumers must read `metadata.noise_distribution` (not `metadata.noise`) and `metadata.shift.mode` (not `metadata.shift.profile`).

## [0.3.3] - 2026-03-03

### Changed

- Refactored generation config validation into explicit staged validators in `src/dagzoo/config.py`:
  stage 1 field normalization/typing, stage 2 cross-field constraints, and stage 3 post-override revalidation.
- `resolve_generate_config()` and `resolve_benchmark_profile_config()` now rely on `GeneratorConfig.validate_generation_constraints()` as the single post-override revalidation pass.
- Classification configs now enforce split feasibility for both `dataset.n_classes_min` and `dataset.n_classes_max` (previously only `n_classes_min` was checked).
- `runtime.device: null` is normalized to `auto` during staged validation.
- Added/updated tests for ordering-sensitive constraints and override-driven revalidation behavior.
- Documented validation stages in `docs/config-resolution.md`.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-03-03

### Changed

- Added internal typed layout contracts in `core/layout_types.py`:
  `LayoutPayload`, `FeatureType`, `ConverterKind`, `MechanismFamily`, and
  `AggregationKind`.
- Updated generation/layout/metadata wiring to use typed layout payloads
  instead of untyped `dict[str, Any]` signatures.
- Node pipeline now exposes explicit feature-key parsing (`parse_feature_key`)
  and uses helper boundaries for latent-dimension resolution and latent padding.
- Multi-parent function composition now supports optional explicit aggregation
  selection while preserving random-selection default behavior.
- Clarified DAG adjacency direction contract in generation/docs:
  `adjacency[src, dst]` means `src -> dst`; parent lookup is column-based.
- Standardized seed derivation callsites in `core/dataset.py` behind named
  helper functions for attempts, node-spec sampling, and split permutations.
- Internal naming cleanup across layout/dataset/node codepaths for clearer
  node/feature/dimension semantics.
- No CLI flag changes, no lineage schema version changes, and no dataset
  metadata contract changes.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-03

### Changed

- Added a shared config-resolution engine (`core/config_resolution.py`) used by both `generate` and benchmark profile execution paths.
- Added per-run field-level effective config trace artifacts:
  - `generate`: `effective_config_trace.yaml`
  - `benchmark`: `effective_configs/*_trace.yaml`
- Added CLI flags `--print-resolution-trace` for `generate` and `benchmark`.
- Benchmarks now include per-profile `effective_config_trace` payloads in summary output.
- Added canonical precedence documentation: `docs/config-resolution.md`.
- **Breaking:** `dataset.categorical_ratio_min` and `dataset.categorical_ratio_max` now validate strictly in `[0, 1]` at config load time.
- Updated shipped config presets to use in-range categorical ratio bounds (`0.0..1.0`).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-03

### Changed

- **Rename: `cauchy-generator` is now `dagzoo`.** Package name, CLI entrypoint, Python import paths, and all internal references updated. The CLI command is now `dagzoo` (was `cauchy-gen`). Python imports change from `from cauchy_generator.…` to `from dagzoo.…`.
- **Breaking:** Lineage schema name changed from `cauchy_generator.dag_lineage` to `dagzoo.dag_lineage`. Existing Parquet files with embedded lineage metadata will fail validation against the new schema name.
- `sample_cauchy_dag` renamed to `sample_dag`; `graph/cauchy_graph.py` renamed to `graph/dag_sampler.py`.
- Noise rollout presets for generate/benchmark smoke workflows (`configs/preset_noise_*.yaml`)
- Noise workflow script wrapper (`scripts/generate-noise.sh`)
- Noise benchmark guardrail reporting (`noise_guardrails`) for runtime delta vs gaussian control and metadata validity
- Noise feature guide (`docs/features/noise.md`) and usage/workflow documentation updates
- Benchmark profile summaries now surface noise guardrail status in CLI and Markdown reports
- **Breaking:** removed `noise.family=legacy`; default noise family is now explicit `gaussian`.
- **Breaking:** removed config/runtime compatibility knobs `runtime.hardware_aware`, CLI `--no-hardware-aware`, and graph aliases `graph.n_nodes_log2_min/max`.
- **Breaking:** `shift.mode` no longer accepts boolean aliases; only explicit string values are allowed.
- Hardware detection and policy are now separated: `hardware.py` handles detection and `hardware_policy.py` handles explicit scaling policy.
- Added hardware policy registry APIs (`apply_hardware_policy`, `register_hardware_policy`, `list_hardware_policies`) with immutable policy application semantics.
- Added CLI `--hardware-policy` and `--print-effective-config` options; generate/benchmark runs now persist resolved effective config artifacts.
- Fixed-layout plan schema now requires a non-null `compatibility_snapshot` payload.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added

- Shift profile schema, sampling integration, and metadata/diagnostics observability across generation and benchmarks
- Configurable noise family schema/samplers (`legacy`, `gaussian`, `laplace`, `student_t`, `mixture`) with profile/preset coverage
- Many-class generation envelope and class-aware filtering/diagnostics presets for benchmark and generate workflows
- Fixed-layout batch generation APIs with emitted schema stability guarantees
- Curriculum shell runner (`scripts/generate-curriculum.sh`) for staged dataset batches with manifest output
- Additional guidance docs and feature references (`docs/how-it-works.md`, `docs/design-decisions.md`, `docs/glossary.md`, `docs/output-format.md`, `docs/usage-guide.md`)

### Changed

- Dataset generation flow now favors fixed-layout execution paths instead of curriculum staging APIs
- Tiny split/postprocess and DAG sampling steps run on CPU to avoid underutilized GPU kernels
- Benchmark/docs workflows now include shift/noise/many-class/curriculum shell guidance and presets

### Fixed

- Noise sampling stability improvements, including Student-t support on MPS and tighter mixture reproducibility guards
- Fixed-layout compatibility validation hardening for resolved device checks and feature/node bounds
- Curriculum shell manifest accounting/status fixes for aborted and dry-run chunk handling

### Removed

- Legacy steering hard-fail path and associated deprecated hard-fail tests

## [0.1.14] - 2026-02-26

### Added

- Curriculum stage schema/validation and stagewise runtime scaling for feature/node/depth/structure complexity
- Curriculum benchmark presets/guardrails and curriculum metadata diagnostics (`metadata.curriculum.realized_complexity`, `stage_bounds`, `monotonicity_axes`)
- DAG lineage artifact pipeline with compact shard outputs (`adjacency.bitpack.bin`, `adjacency.index.json`) and benchmark lineage guardrails (`lineage_guardrails`)
- Lineage benchmark smoke preset: `configs/preset_lineage_benchmark_smoke.yaml`

### Changed

- Diagnostics extraction now normalizes bundles to CPU and delegates metric computation to `core/steering_metrics.py`, avoiding non-CPU float64 failures (notably MPS)
- Internal refactors removed dataset/benchmark compatibility shims and consolidated duplicated helper/constants wiring across CLI/core modules
- README/roadmap/implementation docs expanded lineage/curriculum workflows and benchmark guardrail guidance

### Fixed

- Curriculum validation hardening across stage bounds, node/depth consistency, singleton DAG handling, and stratified split retry sizing
- Lineage artifact correctness/resilience: assignment alignment with postprocessed features, adjacency type validation, bounded blob descriptors, and robust index flushing on failures
- Benchmark lineage guardrail robustness for non-runtime probe handling and undersized runtime gating

### Removed

- `RuntimeConfig` keys: `generation_engine`, `gpu_name_hint`, `gpu_memory_gb_hint`, `peak_flops_hint`
- `SeedManager.numpy_rng`

### Compatibility

- Configs that still set `runtime.generation_engine` now fail fast during config load (`TypeError`).

## [0.1.13] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed

- Diagnostics coverage aggregation now uses deterministic reservoir sampling per metric with configurable retention cap (`diagnostics.max_values_per_metric`) to bound memory on long runs

## [0.1.7] - 2026-02-22

### Changed

- Eliminated NumPy bottlenecks across generation pipeline: `functions/`, `linalg/`, and converters now use torch-native implementations
- Steering candidate scoring uses torch-native metric path and torch softmax selection to avoid CPU/NumPy round trips on accelerator runs

### Fixed

- Correlated beta sampling no longer reseeds process-wide Torch RNG state; draws now use a local seed-derived generator for reproducibility isolation
